# Pie Filling

This is not going to progress but want to leave the code here until I'm ready to come back and review it later.

Goal: Connect to Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth, setup wifi credentials, and connect to the internet.

Connected and set credentials but I wasn't able to have it pick up those credentials and connect, hadn't figured out how to debug it just yet.
